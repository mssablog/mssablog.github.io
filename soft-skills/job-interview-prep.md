## Job Interview Prep

### Introduction

Although it's impossible to prepare for every possible question that might come up during an interview, there are a few that are fairly common and that you can expect to answer at some point.  It's not a bad idea to reflect on these questions and plan for the core themes you want to touch on in your responses (although be aware that over-preparing for a particular question can lead to an answer that sounds scripted - try to avoid this).  Over time, practicing for interviews will help you get better at communicating your value effectively, regardless of the specific question you get asked!

(Note: This page focuses on preparing for behavioral and cultural fit interviews.  For guidance on preparing for your technical interviews, see the resources page for your cohort's learning path.)
