## Networking and LinkedIn

### Introduction

It's never too early to start building your professional network.  One of the most significant benefits of the MSSA program is that it exposes you to a wide breadth of companies and contacts during your job search.  Networking, especially with individuals who already work in your chosen job field, is extremely valuable for gaining insight into your future career and can also help you identify job opportunities in the current market.
