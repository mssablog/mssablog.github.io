## Soft Skills

### Introduction

Welcome to the soft skills section of the MSSA Blog project!

Career guidance is an extremely important part of the MSSA curriculum, and students dedicate a significant amount of time to preparing for job interviews.  The pages in this section should provide additional resources to help with these efforts.

### Content

Soft skills resources are currently organized into the following pages:

* [Elevator Pitch](/soft-skills/elevator-pitch.html)
* [Resume Guidance](/soft-skills/resume-guidance.html)
* [Networking and LinkedIn](/soft-skills/networking-and-linkedin.html)
* [Company Research](/soft-skills/company-research.html)
* [SOAR Stories](/soft-skills/soar-stories.html)
* [Job Interview Prep](/soft-skills/job-interview-prep.html)

More pages on additional topics will be added in the future, so keep checking back!  In the meantime, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/mssablog/mssablog.github.io/issues) if you have an idea for a page you think would be helpful, or create the page yourself and [submit a pull request](/contributing.html)!
