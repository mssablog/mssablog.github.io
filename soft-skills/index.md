## Soft Skills Home

### Introduction

Welcome to the soft skills section of the MSSA Blog project!

Career guidance is an extremely important part of the MSSA curriculum, and students dedicate a significant amount of time to preparing for job interviews.  The pages in this section should provide additional resources to help with these efforts.

### Content

Soft skills resources are currently organized into the following pages (links will be enabled as each page is ready to view):

* [Elevator Pitch](https://mssablog.github.io/soft-skills/elevator-pitch.html)
* Resume Guidance
* Networking and LinkedIn
* Company Research
* SOAR Stories
* Job Interview Prep

More pages on additional topics will be added in the future, so keep checking back!  In the meantime, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/mssablog/mssablog.github.io/issues) if you have an idea for a page you think would be helpful, or create the page yourself and [submit a pull request](https://mssablog.github.io/contributing.html)!

### Contributing

This site is designed with MSSA students in mind, and aims to make contributions easy even for those who have minimal coding experience.  Students and mentors alike are all welcome to submit pull requests.

Take a look at the [Guide to Contributing](https://mssablog.github.io/contributing.html) page for ideas on how you can help and instructions for getting started!
