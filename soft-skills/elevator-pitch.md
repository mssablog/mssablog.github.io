## Elevator Pitch

### Introduction

An elevator pitch is a shorter version of "Tell Me About Yourself" that is used to communicate your value quickly to someone when the situation only allows for a brief conversation (like in an elevator, or meeting someone in passing).  You never know when you might run into networking opportunities for the type of career you're seeking, so the purpose of the elevator pitch is to quickly engage a listener with important and relevant highlights about your personal brand and goals.  Communicating this information effectively can lead to new connections and opportunities!
