## Resources Home

### Introduction

Welcome to the resources section of the MSSA Blog!  This open-source project is an add-on to my [personal blog site](https://mssablog.com/) and is intended as a collaborative hub for soft skills and technical resources.  Use the links in the left sidebar to start discovering learning materials for topics you need more help with!

### Contributing

This site is designed with MSSA students in mind, and aims to make contributions easy even for those who have minimal coding experience.  Students and mentors alike are all welcome to submit pull requests.

Take a look at the [Guide to Contributing](https://mssablog.github.io/contribute.html) page for ideas on how you can help and instructions for getting started!
