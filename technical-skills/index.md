## Technical Skills Home

Welcome to the technical skills section of the MSSA Blog project!

The pages in this section are designed to enhance your understanding of some of the topics in your technical curriculum, and can also serve as inspiration for potential future career paths as you identify specific areas of interest.  This section of the site should ideally prove useful to

* Future students preparing for their cohort,
* Current students who seek other types of resources to supplement their course materials, and
* Additional topics for those who have mastered the basics and are ready for new challenges.

### Content

Technical resources are currently organized by learning path:

* [Cloud Application Developer (CAD)](https://mssablog.github.io/technical-skills/cad/index.html)
* [Server and Cloud Administrator (SCA)](https://mssablog.github.io/technical-skills/sca/index.html)
* [Cybersecurity (CYBER)](https://mssablog.github.io/technical-skills/cyber/index.html)
* [General Technical Resources](https://mssablog.github.io/technical-skills/general/index.html)

Pages on additional topics will be continually added to each learning path section, so keep checking back!  In the meantime, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/mssablog/mssablog.github.io/issues) if you have an idea for a page you think would be helpful, or create the page yourself and [submit a pull request](https://mssablog.github.io/contributing.html)!
