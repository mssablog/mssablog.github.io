## CAD Project Ideas

### Introduction

Working on personal projects is highly recommended during the MSSA because it helps you get hands-on experience while boosting your resume.  This page contains some ideas for where to start and what to work on!

### Project Ideas

#### Upskilling Exercises and Projects

A few simpler projects and coding exercises to give you additional practice with the fundamentals and technologies you're learning in the MSSA.

[**Basic Coding Exercises**](/technical-skills/cad/project-ideas/basic-coding-exercises.html)  
Exercises to help you ramp up on coding fundamentals that you'd like more experience with.

[**Console Applications**](/technical-skills/cad/project-ideas/console-applications.html)  
Basic applications to help you tie your knowledge together into simple but complete programs.

**Build a Personal Website**  
(Link coming soon!)  
A great way to market yourself that goes above and beyond the standard LinkedIn profile, building a personal website makes use of the skills you're learning in CAD and gives you an awesome accomplishment to talk about during your interviews!

#### Group Projects

Projects with several components that lend themselves well to collaboration.  For a more complete experience, practice using Agile and a project management tool like [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) to track your team's work and progress.

#### Open-Source

Many developers, either as part of their work or on the side, contribute code and give back to the open-source community.  Use the following resources to identify projects that are in need of help, or that you might be interested in working on.

(_Tip: Many projects hosted on Github track pending TODO items in the “Issues” tab – start here to see if there are any tasks that might be a good fit for you!_)

[**Code Triage**](https://www.codetriage.com/)  
This awesome site helps you identify open-source projects in need of help, and even allows you to sign up with your Github account to have a new issue delivered to your inbox every day!

[**Visual Studio Code**](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)  
A lightweight alternative to Visual Studio, VSCode is incredibly popular within the developer community.  Also a great opportunity to contribute to a Microsoft-owned repo!

[**Python**](https://github.com/python)  
Chances are you’ll come across Python and maybe work with it at some point during your course.  Why not contribute with a bugfix or new feature?

...More coming soon!
