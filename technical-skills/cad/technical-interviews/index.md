## CAD Technical Interviews

### Introduction

Use the following resources to prepare for technical interviews for roles aligned with your cohort's learning path.

**Remember**: These questions are intended to help you practice your whiteboarding and how you respond to technical questions in general, but this **_should not be considered a complete list_**.  There is no limit to the possible topics an interviewer might choose to explore with you!

### Sample Interview Questions

#### Numbering Systems/Character Encoding
* Explain how to convert between decimal/binary/hexadecimal numbers.
* What is ASCII?

#### Data Types and Variables
* What is the difference between value and reference types in C#?
* Explain the difference between declaring and defining a variable.
* Is it possible to declare and define multiple variables using a single statement in C#?

#### Operators
* What is the difference between unary and binary operators?
* What does it mean to overload an operator?
* Which operators can be overloaded in C#? Which ones can’t?
* What are bitwise operations, and how do they differ from normal logical operations?

#### Control Structures - Branching
* Is it possible to write an if statement by itself, without a corresponding else? Why or why not?
* Compare and contrast if/else blocks with switch statements, in terms of code readability, efficiency, capabilities, and limitations.
* Write some code that prompts the user for an integer. Determine if the number is odd or even, and output the result to the user via a console message.
* Is the statement “if (0 < x < 10)” valid in C#? Why or why not? What about other programming languages?

#### Control Structures - Loops
* What are the different types of loops used in C#? In what cases is each of these types most useful?
* What is the difference between a pre-test and a post-test loop?
* What are the components inside of the parenthesis of a for loop? Explain the order in which each of the three statements executes as the program runs.
* Can you omit the curly braces surrounding the body of a loop or if/else block?
* What causes an infinite loop? Can you think of a scenario where we might create one intentionally?
* Write some code that contains an infinite loop, and then fix it so it has a stopping point.

#### Scope and Namespaces
* What is a namespace?
* How are namespaces related to the .NET framework?
