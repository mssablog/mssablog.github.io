## General Technical Resources

### Introduction

This general section of the MSSA Blog serves as a collection of resources which are relevant across more than one of the technical learning paths.  Pages include learning resources for general foundational knowledge, websites or programs that serve as hubs for a variety of certifications, whiteboarding tips, and more.  See below!

### Content

General resources are currently organized into the following pages (links will be enabled as each page is ready to view):

* Learning Resources
* Certification Hubs
* Whiteboarding Tips

More pages on additional topics will be added in the future, so keep checking back!  In the meantime, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/mssablog/mssablog.github.io/issues) if you have an idea for a page you think would be helpful, or create the page yourself and [submit a pull request](/contributing.html)!
